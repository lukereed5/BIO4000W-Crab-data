## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


This project aims so study the population structure and dynamics of the population  of invasive green crabs ar Ganzekraal on the West Coast. The data was collected at night, an hour before the spring low tide. For an hour 4 people searched for and caught as many crabs as they could, after which the crabs were all weighed, measured for length and width, sexed and any missing limbs or presence of eggs was noted.

The data for this project is Green Crab Ganzekraal.csv, within the Data folder. Each crab is numbered by sampling mission and individual per mission. So the 5th crab of the first mission will be 1.5 and so on. Width.Carapace and Length.Carapace and the width and length of each crabs carapace, Weight and Sex are the wight and sex of each crab, Beried is whether or not the crab has eggs. Habitat is either Wall, Open, or Pool, which are the 3 different areas in which we found the crabs. Misssing.Chelae and Missing.Walking.Leg indicate whether or not the crab was missing any of its limbs, and how many. This was only recorded from the 2nd sampling mission onwards. Date is the date of capture.
